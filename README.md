## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Screenshot



Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

HTML, CSS
Flex, inline-block



### What I learned - OVERLAY!
The z-index CSS property sets the z-order of a positioned element and its descendants or flex items. Overlapping elements with a larger z-index cover those with a smaller one.
I had a hard time to overlay images, to make one appear on a top of each other.
I have also learnt about using var in css

See code snippets EXAMPLE below:

<div class="hero_img">
   <img src="./images/image-equilibrium.jpg" alt="Equilibrium, a multicolor cube" />
   <div class="overlay">
      <img src="./images/icon-view.svg" alt="">
   </div>
</div>

..overlay {
  position: absolute;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  z-index: 1;
  background-color: hsla(178deg, 100%, 50%, 0.5);
  opacity: 0;
  display: grid;
  place-content: center;
  transition: opacity 200ms ease-in-out;
}
.overlay img {
  width: 3rem;
  height: 2rem;
}
.overlay:hover {
  opacity: 1;
}
